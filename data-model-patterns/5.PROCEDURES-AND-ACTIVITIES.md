# PROCEDURES AND ACTIVITIES

这一章会建模这些服务，流程，行为。描述内部活动，工作订单。仍会描述相似性在不同的工作订单，为了维护，生产，项目管理等。
This chapter will model these services, procedures, and activities. It describes internal activities and work orders, along with the consumption of labor and materials by those activities and work orders. It also discusses the similarities among and differences between various kinds of work orders those for maintenance, production, project management, and responses to safety incidents.

## SOME DEFINITIONS

我们为啥要定义这些行为作为模型，这个和模型化函数不一样。相较于去描述什么将完成，我们可以用这个模型去展示活动，流程，服务，在业务中的意义，以及他们的相关项。
Understand, by the way, that when we model actions as entities, it is not the same thing as modeling actions as functions. Rather than using the model to describe the nature of what is being done,we can use it to show that activities,procedures, and services are themselves things of significance to the business,and that they are related as things to other things, For example, these activities, procedures, and services may be related to the people, organizations, and products discussed in the previous two chapters.

我们这一章的模板不是如此丰富的去描述这些行为，而仅仅定义这些需要的数据。
Our goal in this chapter is not so much to describe the actions themselves,but to identify the data required to describe them.

如果一个行为对外，可以叫服务，如果它仅是内部处理业务，可以叫程序。如果关注于项目管理，可以更抽象得称为活动类型。
As was the case with products, it is necessary to distinguish the definition of a service or procedure from examples of it. The definitions are represented by an entity that may variously be called SERVICE, ACTIVITY TYPE, or PROCEDURE. If the activity is sold to the outside, it is probably called SERVICE. If it is simply something done internally as part of doing business, it is a PROCEDURE. If the focus is on project management, it may be called more abstractly ACTIVITY TYPE.All three of these names refer to the definition of a set of steps that constitute a task. Attributes include "description," "expected duration," and so forth. For most of this chapter, we'll call the entity a PROCEDURE, but the other names would work as well.

The actual carrying out of a PROCEDURE is an ACTIVITY. Important attributes of an ACTIVITY are "scheduled start date," "scheduled end date," "actual start date," and so fort.

活动被程序所指向，一个程序可能实现一个或多个活动。这个图描画了一个组织关注于跟踪即兴的活动或者跟踪之前定义好的流程。如果仅关注的活动被之前定义的程序所执行，这个图就能改变去展示活动。
Figure 5.1 shows that an ACTIVITY may be to carry out a PROCEDURE, while a PROCEDURE may be implemented in one or more actual ACTIVITIES.This figure depicts an organization interested in keeping track of impromptu ACTIVITIES ----- as well as ones that are the execution of predefined PROCEDURES.If the only ACTIVITIES of interest were those to carry out predefined PROCEDURES, the diagram would have to be changed to show a solid line coming from ACTIVITY.That is,in some organizations, it might be more accurate to assert that each ACTIVITY must be to carry out a PROCEDURE.

## DIVIDING ACTIVITIES

Figure 5.2 shows two other aspects of activities: First, the steps that constitute the PROCEDURE may be called occurrences of PROCEDURE STEP,while the actual steps performed when the activity is carried out are occurrences of ACTIVITY STEP.That is, each ACTIVITY may be composed of one or more ACTIVITY STEPS,and each PROCEDURE may be composed of one or more PROCEDURE STEPS.

这适用于，若活动是十分清晰得定义在一个层级。当流程或活动可以被切分到更远，细化到子级。那就需要另一种方式了。
This is suitable when procedures and activities are clearly defined for only one level. When procedures or activities are divided into steps that are then divided further into substeps, and so forth,a second approach is needed, which is to divide each PROCEDURE into smaller PROCEDURES and each ACTIVITY into smaller ACTIVITIES.In Figure 5.2, for example, the pig's ear symbol on ACTIVITY shows that an ACTIVITY may be composed of one or more other ACTIVITIES,each of which in turn may be composed of yet more ACTIVITIES, and so forth.

A project(ACTIVITY)to build a house, for example, includes an ACTIVITY to lay the foundation,which may in turn encompass the ACTIVITIES of surveying the ground,putting in footings, and so forth. When it is modeled this way, the process can be extended indefinitely.

An ACTIVITY, then, either may be composed of one or more ACTIVITY STEPS (as described above) or may be composed of one or more other ACTIVITIES.

A corresponding pig's ear appears on PROCEDURE, showing that a PROCEDURE also either may be composed of one or more PROCEDURE STEPS, or may be composed of one or more other PROCEDURES. These component PROCEDURES may be broken down into successively smaller PROCEDURES. This way of breaking things down into progressively smaller pieces is shown in Figure 5.2.

注意，若一个活动由流程来执行，由理由相信活动步骤可能基于相符的流程步骤。比如，一个一次性的活动可以被永久的流程构造所实现，当然这最终依赖于实际情况。
Note that in Figure 5.2, if an ACTIVITY is to carry out a PROCEDURE, it is reasonable to expect that an ACTIVITY STEP may be based on a corresponding PROCEDURE STEP. That is, the structure of a one-time activity may be derived from the permanent structure of the procedure it is implementing. Whether this is in fact so will depend on actual circumstances.

一个更加简洁的方式来呈现同样的配置在5.3。在这幅图里，一个活动步骤是活动的子类型，一个流程步骤是流程的子类型，每个流程可能被一个或多个流程组成，每个活动都由一个或多个活动组成。
A more compact way of showing this same configuration appears in Figure 5.3. In this drawing, an ACTIVITY STEP is a subtype of ACTIVITY, and PROCEDURE STEP is a subtype of PROCEDURE. Thus, each OTHER PROCEDURE may be composed of one or more PROCEDURES (either PEOCEDURE STEPS or OTHER PROCEDURES), and each OTHER ACTIVITY may be composed of one or more ACTIVITIES (either ACTIVITY STEPS or OTHER ACTITIES). This configuration allows each structure to go down as many levels as necessary. PROCEDURE STEP and ACTIVITY STEP are not required, but if they are specified, they can only be at the bottom of each respective structure .

In Figure 5.3, we are asserting that each ACTIVITY (ACTIVITY STEP or OTHER ACTIVITY) may be part of one and only one OTHER ACTIVITY. Similarly, each' PROCEDURE (PROCEDURE STEP or OTHER PROCEDURE) may be part of one and only one OTHER PROCEDURE. In your organization, this may be true-but then again, it may not be. 

It is conceivable that a PROCEDURE STEP (such as "assemble the framis") might be part of more than one larger procedure (such as "fix the scrope" and "calibrate the flim-flam rods"). In that case, the part of /composed of relationships in Figures 5.2 and 5.3 would be "many-to-many," requiring the addition of intersect entities. This would be a "structure" entity, such as the GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENT discussed in Chapter Three, or the ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT in Chapter Four. This is less common than the one-to-many version, however, so we shall not pursue it here.

## WORK ORDERS

若工作用行为和程序来表示，那么支持这项工作的活动可以定义为工作顺序。一个工作顺序通常直接收入到文档里。工作顺序必须授权多个活动。注意，在一些组织里，一个活动可以执行但没有通过工作顺序授权。一个行为仅被一个工作顺序授权这是一个关系。你需要去决定这种关系是否需要强制执行。
While the work to be done is represented by ACTIVITIES and PROCEDURES, sponsorship of the work is represented by the entity WORK ORDER. (See Figure 5.4.) That is, a WORK ORDER is usually embodied in a document authorizing work to be done--the ACTIVITIES. A WORK ORDER may be the authorization for one or more ACTIVITIES. Note, however, that in some organizations, an activity may be carried out without being authorized by a work order. Hence, the relationship that each ACTIVITY may be authorized by one WORK ORDER. You will have to decide in your organization whether that relationship should be mandatory.

一个工作顺序必定由某人负责。
As with the ACTIVITIES it authorizes, a WORK ORDER may be composed of smaller WORK ORDERS, before ACTIVITIES are assigned to it. A WORK ORDER must be the responsibility of someone (usually a PERSON, but it could be an ORGANIZATION, so the relationship points to PARTY). It is probably prepared by a PERSON as well.

在工作顺序内的授权被实践以实现工作顺序的目的。显而易见，工作顺序可以被多个流程执行。
The authorization embodied in a WORK ORDER is exercised to fulfill the WORK ORDER'S purpose. Typically, the wORK ORDER may be defined to carry out one or more PROCEDURES, to make an ASSET TYPE, or to fix, install, remove, or inspect a specific PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. A PROCEDURE implemented by a WORK ORDER may itself be defined to fix, install, remove, or inspect an ASSET TYPE (which is most likely a PART /EQUIPMENT TYPE).

In addition to "work order number," "order quantity," and "order date," attributes of WORK ORDER might include "expected start date," "actual start date," "expected end date," "actual end date," and so forth.

## LABOR USAGE

人在独立的活动和工作顺序里扮演不同的角色。可能有管理人员，技术角色。
PEOPLE (and ORGANIZATIONS too, for that matter) play different roles in both individual ACTIVITIES and WORK ORDERS as a whole. These could be administrative roles (such as project secretary), or technical roles (such as chief engineer). There are several ways to represent this, as shown in Figure 5.5: A PARTY may be given one or more WORK ORDER ROLES in a WORK ORDER. Each WORK ORDER ROLE, then, is played by a PARTY in a WORK ORDER. Each WORK ORDER ROLE must be defined by a WORK ORDER ROLE TYPE, such as "project manager."

或者，规划好的工作顺序的活动，party可能给予特定的活动任务于活动。每个活动任务，是party的一个活动。每个活动任务必定是活动任务类型来定义的，比如统计。
Alternatively, as the ACTIVITIES within a wORK ORDER are being planned, a PARTY could be given a specific ACTIVITY ASSIGnMENT to an ACTIVITY (an ACTIVITY STEP or an OTHER ACTIVITY). Each ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENT, then, is of a PARTY to an ACTIVITY. Each ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENT must be defined by an ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENT TYPE, such as "statistician."

在大多是
In most cases, these WORK ORDER ROLES and ACTIVITY ASSIGNMENTS will be about a PERSON. ORGANIZATIONS (such as subcontractors) can also participate in WORK ORDERS and ACTIVITies, however. So, the more conservative approach is to link WORK ORDER ROLES and ACTIVITY ASSIGNMEnt to PARTY, as is depicted in Figure 5.5.
