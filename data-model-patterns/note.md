# 书里面的关键语句

## chapter 2

in this book,however,we are mostly concerned with whether we have identified the right entities and whether the are properly linked.issues of unique identifiers and the mandatoriness of attributes come up later in the analysis process,and don't have to be taken into account as the data model is first drawn.this is not to suggest that the info should not be gathered,bus success in analysis depends on collection info in the right order.in order to maintain perspective,it's important to begin by capturing general concepts and then filling in details as you go along.a common failing among analysis is to become so bogged down with details as to lose sight of what is to be accomplished
**在本书里，我们关注于如何定义实体的唯一性以及他们联系的正确性。如何保证唯一性和他们的内部元素会在接下来的分析流程里考虑。不建议一开始就把模型的属性都考虑进来，按正确的顺序采集信息是分析建模的成功保障。为了保障关注核心，应该一开始抓住核心概念然后填充实体。一种常见的失败在建模中就是一开始过度关注细节而丢失了整体观念**

## chapter 3

in real projects,however,you rarely are called upon to encompass a wide range of circumstances.your client or user will have a practical problem to be addressed quickly and in terms that he or she understands.it may be unavoidable that you have to draw a model in those terms.So be it.The rent must be paid.Even when this happens,however,it is to your advantage at least understand the more abstract model.You may even want to sketch it out on paper and file it,so you have answer if(when?)the clients has a change of mind and widening of perspective-immediately followed by the demand for you to deal with it("I know that's what I said then,but this is now!!!")
**在实际项目里，需要你封装一个大范围的实际情况。你的客户和用户有特定的问他需要定位和处理。这在你建模时是不可避免的。因此就这么做吧，得付钱啊。可是，你的优势就是通过理解更多的抽象模型，你甚至想把这些记录下来，画下来。你就会去想何时，什么时候，客户改变想法，去处理这些未来可能出现的问题。**

## chapter 4

the first rule of data modeling,after all,is:Know your audience and present a drawing that is appropriate to that audience.**建模第一原则：了解你的听众，并且呈现他们能理解的模型图**

本章主要都在描述抽象的公司的产品，产品类型，产品的元素，提到了元数据模型，看得有点云里雾里。
