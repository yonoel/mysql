# things of enterprise

这一章关注于企业操控的。报告，企业生产的商品，它使用的原材料，以及它的物理资产。
this chapter is concerned with what that enterprise manipulates.this includes the products it makes,the raw materials it uses,and its physical assets.Since all companies deal with sth,the structure of this portion of the model can be similar for all.The differences,however,are at the heart of what makes each company's model unique.

之前我们说实体是有一定意义的，这报告交易记录，和其他不可触摸的实体。这里我们就讨论那些企业可触摸的，可用的，可生产的，可卖的东西。
Previously we spoke entities as being "thins of significance,"and include in that category transactions and other intangible things as potential entities.Here we speak only for tangible things that company uses,makes,and sells.

in all these cases,it will be your job as a modeler first to recognize the products an organization uses and products,and then to see how they are related to each other,to other aspects of the enterprise,and to its mission.

## products and product type

第一点，为了模型化意义，需要区分东西的版本和物理化的东西。
First the distinction:For a model to make a sense,it is essential to distinguish between the specification of things and the physical things themselves.A product type describe the nature of product.A product,on the other hand,is the physical thing itself.Both product and product types are things of significance to the organization.A product type is usually identified by a "model number" or its equivalent and its other attributes describe characteristics of the model,regardless of the number of physical copies that may exist.

figure 4.1 shows this distinction.it shows that each product must be an example of one and only one product type,and each product type may be embodied in one or more products.Note that a product type usually defined before any physical copies-products-are actually made.

in this case,however,we make the domain into an entity,for several reasons:

+ First of all,product type is clearly sth of significance to the company.the list of product types is a list of product with which company deals,and this must be explicit in the model.
+ Second,the list of product types is probably dynamic.Occurrence are being added and deleted all the time.this means that the list should be maintained as a table,not encoded into a program as a domain.

figure 4.2 shows that it may be useful to group both products and product types into product categories.

若一个产品仅是一种产品类型的例子，一个产品类型可以被归类到不止一个到产品名目。这就要求我们去定义归类，每一个归类是一个产品或者产品类型归类到产品名目。
while a product is an example of only one product type,a product type may be classified into more than one product category.this requires us to define classification,where each classification is of either a product or a product type into product category.

So much for the distinction. Now for the grouping: Sometimes, in addition to discrete pieces of hardware, it is important to deal with powders and goo (that is, chemicals). The model just presented applies to them as well, since with them, we also must distinguish between the definition of a material (a MATERIAL TYPE) and examples of it (typically in INVENTORY somewhere). It is not a stretch to expand our definition of PRODUCT TYPE, then, to include products that are not discrete items. For example, you may be in need of five gallons of robin's egg blue house paint (a MATERIAL TYPE). A nearby hardware store could obtain five actual gallons for you (or, more likely, 4.98 gallons or 5.05 gallons) of a paint (the MATERIAL) that is approximately robin's egg blue in color.

While the examples above dealt with personal possessions, the entities PRODUCT and PRODUCT TYPE are in fact introduced here to describe the items a company makes, or those that any organization uses to carry out its work.

In addition to expanding PRODUCT and PRODUCT TYPE to include chemicals, we can also expand these terms to accommodate the physical equipment that constitutes the manufacturing facility itself. Like the products or materials made there, all the valves, boilers, instruments, and pipes that make up a plant must be defined and specified. In addition, the concept of MATERIAL TYPE can also neatly cover supplies, such as lubricants, catalysts, and cleaning agents.

Once we have expanded the list of things that concern us beyond the realm of the products that we make, we require a more general set of terms. In fact,what concerns us are all the physical ASSETSof the company. This more general term can ultimately encompass all physical things of interest-buildings, roads,and bridges; the hardware that constitutes the plant; inventories of the company's products; and so forth. Because of the wide range of situations to be described in this book, this general term ASSET will help prevent confusion later on.

In a real modeling situation, of course, the analyst will be called upon to give this and all entities names that preserve their generality but which are as meaningful as possible to the organization involved. In a model for a manufacturer, for example, the entity almost surely must be named PRODUCT.Because we are concerned with more than manufacturing in this book, however, we will use the term ASSET(and ASSEt TyPE, ASSET CATEGORY, and so forth) .

Figure 4.3, then, shows PRODUCT TYPE generalized to ASSET TYPE. The diagram shows how an ASSET TYPE may be a PRODUCT tYPE(in the original sense of a piece of hardware sold by the company), a MATERIAL TYPE,a PART/EQUIPMENT TYPE,or an OTHER ASSET TYPE. The particular combination of products, parts, and materials in your plant may affect the particular way you divide up and name this entity, but Figure 4.3 is representative .

## inventory

扩拖资产类型到具体到产品类型，原材料类型，设备类型，那么物理资产的拓展点在哪？因为物理资产，在不同的方式有不同的处理路径，因此处理资产会变得有些复杂。物理项显而易见是一个独立的部分，清单，楼等。这个模型必须要抓住每一种物理资产的独一性，尽管模型已经捕获了独立性对于他们所有而言。
If Figure 4.3 expanded ASSET TYPE to include PRODUCt TYPE,MATERIAL TYPE,and PART/EQUIPMENT TYPE,what does this expansion mean for the physical ASSET? Dealing with ASSETS gets a little more complicated, since physical products, parts, and materials are kept track of in several different ways. Physical items show up as individual pieces, inventory, buildings, and so forth. the model must capture what is unique about each kind of physical example of an asset,even as it captures those characteristics that are common to all of them.

如果一个资产被独立成部分，它就是个孤立的一项。每个孤立的一项都是一个资产的唯一的发生。比如企业用的设备，大型或者昂贵的机器，道路，楼等。另一方面，有些资产是一捆计量的，比如厕纸，每个物理资产的发生，是这种资产的一列清单。
if an asset is identified by individual pieces,it is a discrete item.Each discrete item constitutes a unique identifiable occurrence of asset,as previously described.This could be the case with pieces of equipment the company use,large or expensive items that it manufactures,and such things as building and roads.If,on the other hand,the asset is only kept track of in bulk quantity(like toilet paper),each physical occurrence of an asset exist in the from of inventory of that asset.

基于这种原因，两种类型的资产被分割成不同的项和清单。项的首要元素是流水号，清单最主要的元素是数量。注意，这点并不永远都很清晰，易于区分，这依赖于企业的意愿。
For this reason,in Figure 4.4,two kinds of asset are shown-Discrete item and inventory.the primary attribute of discrete item is "serial number"(or "item number"),while the most important attribute of inventory is "quantity" on hand.Note that,this distinction is not always clear cut,and may differ,depending on the enterprise's perspective.Software vendors,for example,may keep track of the serial numbers of their products.Their customer,on the other hand,may not.Even vendors may only use serial numbers for control,without actually using them as the basic for inventory accounting.

因为它的物理存在，一个资产必定在一个物理地址。
Because of its physical existence,an asset(either an inventory or a discrete item)must be(currently)at a particular site,such as a warehouse location or a manufacturing work center.That is,one definition of asset is that it is the physical occurrence of an asset type at a site.

但是如果一个公司不生产？比如他们操作化学品，或食物,药物。我们如何表示他们操作的原材料呢？
but what about companies that don't mark parts?they make chemicals or foodstuff or pharmaceuticals.How do we represent the materials they manipulate?

类似物理资产，物理性的原材料可以简单的表示一种清单。
like physical assets,physical materials can simply be another kind of inventory,when the "quantity" is in a gallons or liters,instead of units.Although fluids and powders can be accommodated by this model and treated like other inventories,however,some industries,such as pharmaceuticals or food processing,require more:While quantities of material are kept track of,each quantity produced by a lot must itself be kept track of discretely.As figure 4.5 shows,a lot may be the source of one or more lot inventories-each another kind of inventory.As with all other inventory,the lot would have "quantity" as an attribute(in this case,usually called lot size).Lots are also counted discretely,just like piece of equipment,so in the manner of discrete item each also has a "lot number".Lot inventories combines the idea of discrete item and inventory.

一个生产原材料的工程并不不一定会把原材料分离，反而会关注工厂的生产设备。。。。无论在劳工局还是公司。
while a plant that produces materials does not necessarily make discrete item,it is concerned with pieces of equipment that constitute the facilities of the plant.pieces of equipment,in turn,are either production facilities,directly involved in the manufacturing activities of the plant,or instruments of various kinds that measure the production process and product quality,either on the shop floor or in the laboratory.

清单也可以被分离得更远。举个例子，一组设备和部件的清单可以被准确得区分成产品清单和制造商品的清单，也有其他的可能性。
inventory also may be further broken down.For example,the party inventory of parts and equipment used in a plant might be explicitly distinguished from the product inventory of products made.There are other possibilities,but the one shown in figure 4.5 typical.

here we see the product type made and sold by discrete manufacturers being embodied in one or more discrete item,product inventories,or party inventories;and material type made and sold by process manufacturers being embodied in one or more product inventories and lot inventories.the part/equipment type used in the manufacturers process is either embodied in one or more part inventories or embodied in one or more pieces of equipment.

Figure 4.5 illustrates something else as well. Figure 4.4 simply asserted that each ASSET must be an example of an ASSET TYPE. No attempt was made to identify which subtypes of ASSET were related to which subtypes of ASSET TYPE. Figure 4.5 tries to remedy this by explicitly saying, for example, that a PART INVENTORY must be an example of either a PRODUCT TYPE or a PART/EQUIPMENT TYPE but not a MATERIAL TYPE. This is certainly being conscientious, and in some circumstances, this kind of detail can be very important. It is at the cost of clarity, however, and if the purpose of the drawing is to win converts to the overall concepts involved, the simpler approach of Figure 4.4 is more effective.

the first rule of data modeling,after all,is:Know your audience and present a drawing that is appropriate to that audience.
**建模第一原则：了解你的听众，并且呈现他们能理解的模型图**

## structure

对于一个制造业主，制造品是和集成品有大大不同。继续我们的进度关注在具体的物理资产，可是我们将看到这里有很大的不同。
to a manufacturer,the things manufactured are quite different from parts that constitute them.continuing our process of general assets,however,we shall see that these too are but different from the same thing.

两个实体，一个是产品类型，一个是完成品类型。每个完成品类型由一个或多个产品类型组成，每个产品类型是一个或多个完成品类型的部分。
two entities for part type and finished product type,in figure 4.6.Each finished product type may be composed of one or more part types,and each one part type may be part of one or more finished types.

这个视角的问题是仅统计了一个纬度。通常，部分会集成到子组件，而子组件会集成到下一个纬度的组件，以此类推。这个模型要求一个实体就是一个纬度。对于复杂的制造流程，数据库基于此模型创造的表几乎不可能维护。这个模型在任何一个卖部分组件作为完成品的公司都不会有效。
the problem with this view is that it only accounts for one level.Often parts are assembled into subassembly,which in turn are assembled into the next level of subassembly,so forth.the model shown would require an entity for every level,in figure 4.7.For complex manufacturing processes,a database created according to this model would be nearly impossible to maintain.this model also doesn't work in any company that sells parts or subassembly as finished products.

总而言之，这样的模型，仅适用在那种产品是永久且无法恢复且能区分开是个部分还是完成品的公司。这样的公司生产产品在固定数量的步骤，这样的公司很少。
in short,such model would only be appropriate in a company for which all products can be permanently and irrevocably be classified as either a part or a finished product,and which makes finished products in a defined number of steps from parts.Such companies are rare.

基于这样的原因，继承资产类型是更简单的选择。这次就要考虑部分，子组件，最终产品在一个实体里。在这个模型，资产类型指代了某一种物理资产，忽略了这个产品在产品构造种的纬度。
For these reason,it is better simply to extend asset type yet again-this time to consider parts,subassemblies and finish products in the same entity.in this case,asset type refers to the specification of any physical item in the plant,regardless of what level it is in the product's structure.

如果我们把产品类型和最终品类型藏进资产类型，那么资产类型和其自身就有一个多对多关系。每个资产类型可能由一个或多个资产类型组成。
if we collapse part type and finished product type into asset type,the relationship between them becomes a many-to-many relationship between asset type and itself.that is,each asset type may be now composed of one or more other asset types.similarly,each asset type may be part of one or more other asset types.

这个模型有问题，可是，由于双方的关系都是多对多，每个资产类型都是在另个资产类型被使用。比如我们想统计平均质量，这就比较难统计。
this model has a problem,however,both because the relationship now is many-to-many,and because each asset type's use in another asset type itself has attributes.specifically,for each use of one asset type in another,we want to know the "quantity per"-the amount of the component that goes into the assembly.this is not an attribute of either asset type,but of the usage of one asset type in another.

去文档化每个产品类型中的其他产品类型，维持丢失的有用的元素，我们创造了一个构造模型，像图片构造节点或者报告关系模型。这次我们称其为产品类型构造元素。每个产品构造元素必定是一个产品类型在另一个产品类型。每个产品类型，必定由一个或多个产品类型构造元素组成。
to document each occurrence of an asset type making of another asset type,and to hold the missing usage attributes,we create another structure entity,like the Geographic Structure Element and Reporting Relationship of chapter three.this one we will call asset type structure element,in figure 4.9.Each asset type structure element must be one asset type in another asset type.each asset type,then may be a component in one or more asset type structure elements,each of which is in one other asset type.

this means that an asset type with twelve components will be an assembly of twelve asset type structure element,each of which is of a different component asset type.Similarly, an ASSET TYPE that is a component of four other ASSET TYPES will be a component in four ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT occurrences, each of which is in a different parent ASSET TYPE.

As mentioned above, the most important attribute of ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT is "quantity per"-the quantity of the component (in the component's unit of measure) required to make one unit of the assembly or parent ASSET TYPE (in the parent's unit of measure). Additional attributes may include such things as "scrap percent" (the percent of a component's usage that is typically lost as scrap), "effective da te," and so forth.

we have called this entity Asset type structure element because if refers to the structure of any asset type,whatever it may be.in a discrete manufacturing environment,where asset called products,the entity could be called product structure element.

This entity is analogous to a data file that is known commonly in the manufacturing world as the "product structure" file. The set of structureS' and ASSET TYPES describing all the components of an assembly is called a "bill of materials."

On the other hand, we-can infer from Figure 4.10 that chemical manufacturers might call an ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT a MATERIAL STRUCTURE ELEMENT,and those concerned with maintenance might call it a PART/EQUIPMENT STRUCTURE ELEMENT.

**Note that,as we saw when generalizing,organization in chapter 2 and 3,generalizing here does lose any business rules about what kind of assets can go into what other kinds of assets,and it does not allow us expelicitly to prevent "loops"(A is used in B,which is used in A).as with organization example,any such business rules must be described outside the model**

this approach to structure can describe relationships other than the components of asset types.other relationships may be defined for categories of asset types.an asset type relationship for an asset type,for example,might show one of the following,as in figure4.11:

+ an asset type structure element,as just discussed,for any asset type.
+ an electrical connection between two part/equipment types
+ a safety connection between one part/equipment type and any other part/equipment that must be turned off to work on it.
+ an incompatibility between two material types

Where an ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT defines the relationship between ASSET TYPES as designed, the relationships between real, physical objects are contained in ASSET STRUCTURE ELEMENT, as shown in Figure 4.12.

ignoring for the moment other kinds of asset type relationships,we show the complete model of what we've discussed so far in figure 4.13.

所有在组织独立的项，清单或者其他资产，比如楼，道路都是资产的一个例子。定义这种资产的存在便是一个资产类型。事实上，一个特定的资产类型是一个资产构造类型的一个内在部分，并且一个特定的资产实际上是一个资产构造元素的部分。注意资产构造元素和资产类型构造元素之间的联系。很明智的声明一个资产构造元素基于一个资产类型构造元素。当然这基于你的情况。在有些情况下，一个资产构造元素必定基于一个资产构造类型元素。有些情况，就不强制要求。
All physical things in the organization DIscRETE ITEMS,INVENTORIES or, OTHER ASSETS such as buildings or roads-are examples of ASSETS.The definition of each of these things exists as an ASSET TYPE. The fact that one specified ASSET TYPE is inherently part of another is an ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT,and the fact that one specified ASSET is actually part of another is an ASSET STRUCTURE ELEMENT.note the connection between ASSET STRUCTURE ELEMENT and ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT.It is reasonable to assume that each ASSET STRUCTURE ELEMENT is based on an ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT.Whether this is in fact so,however, depends upon your situation. In some cases, an actual ASSET STRUCTURE ELEMENT must be based on an ASSET TYPE STRUCTURE ELEMENT.In other situations, this is not required.

## heterogeneous entities 多个实体(meta-data原数据模型)

假定数据建模基于所有实体都有相同的元素。若有独立的实体，那么就会丢失部分元素，但是实体基础的构造预期都是相同的。
an assumption in data modeling is that all occurrences of an entity have same attributes.while individual occurrences may lack values for one or more attributes,the basic structure of entity's info is expected to be same for all.

在许多公司的资产类型都会带来这种假设成为问题，处理这种问题的方式在许多领域都有用。
the asset type entity in many companies can bring this assumption into question,and dealing with it involves a modeling tech that is useful in many areas.

问题：一个资产类型可能有多种类型。
the problem is this:an asset type may be of various kinds.In a power plant, for example, an ASSET TYPE might be a type of compressor, a kind of pipe segment, a brand of computer, or a type of instrument.

一种方式，声明资产类型和资产类型类别。一个资产类型类别由多个资产类型来区分开。在这种案例，资产类型类别是一组基于资产类型的唯一性来区分的。
one way to represent this appears in figure 4.14,which show asset type and asset type class.an asset type class is shown here to be a classification for one or more asset types.in this case,asset type class is the category that defines characteristics of the asset type,so each asset type must be an example of one and only one asset type.here,if new classed are needed,occurrence of asset type class are simply added.subsequent occurrences of asset type can then point to the new asset type class.

不幸的是，所有资产类型都有相同的元素，这是不太现实的。。。。每一个子类都包含它独有的元素。这样很怪异，可是，因为新的子类随时都有可能添加。每次新的资产类型被定下，数据库基于此模型的表也要改变。
unfortunately,in this model, all occurrences of ASSET TYPE must still have the same attributes-something that is unrealistic when dealing with pieces of pipe, gasoline, and sophisticated monitoring equipment. An alternative would be to model the situation as in Figure 4.15, where each subtype can have its own attributes. This is awkward, however, because new subtypes are being added all the time. With this, every time a new kind of ASSET TYPE is defined,the database derived from this model would have to be changed.

如果以上都不生效，我们能做什么呢？答案基于创造性的使用资产类型类别。一个资产类型类别被定义去特意区分，用于分组资产类型基于他们的唯一性，在数据里，便是他们的元素。随着这些定义，每个资产类型都仅是一个资产类型类别的部分。
if neither of these approach works,what can we do?the answer lies in making creative use of the asset type class from figure4.14.An asset type class is defined here to be particular classification that groups asset types into categories according their characteristics,which in data terms are their attributes.With this definition,each asset type is an embodiment of only one asset type class.The SuperStar MP33 / 486, then, is in the ASSET TYPE CLASS"computers," since all computers have the same attributes (or at least the ones that concern us). Their being "Intel computers" or "beige computers" does not affect their attributes. All computers have "processor speed," "disk space," "RAM," and so forth. They don't have (or at least we don't care about)"length," "inside diameter," or "tensile strength," such as pieces of pipe might have.

In Figure 4.16, "pump" is an example of the entity ASSET TYPE CLASS, which is a classification for the "Jones co Model 1650 pump."

第二种解决方案是，定义个模型去包含所有资产类型可能使用到的元素。
a second part of the solution is to define an entity to contain definitions of all the attributes that might be used for any of the asset types.attributes of attribute include its name,format(character,numeric,or date),unit of measure,and optionally,default high and low value.the occurrences of this entity would include the "disk space" and "tensile length" described above,as well as "capacity" in the pump example in figure 4.16.

63页丢失，4.15也没了

附加一句，元素声明可以包括高低值，
in addition, ATTRIBUTE ASSIGNMENT might also include high and low values, which would specifically apply to this ATTRIBUTE'S use for this ASSET TYPE CLASS. That is, "capacity" might in all uses be between a and 100,000 gallons per minute, but when used to describe a pump, capacity can only be between a and 10,000 gallons per minute.

图4.16也展示了特殊的资产类型可以由值对象来描述。
Figure 4.16 also shows how a particular ASSET TYPE of this ASSET TYPE CLASS can then be described by VALUES for each ATTRlBUTE that is appropriate to the ASSET TYPE CLASS. For example, the "Jonesco Model 1650 pump" is described by a VALUE of the ATTRIBUTE "capacity," which in this example is "500 gallons/minute."

特别要关注资产类型元素的每一个值，当资产类型是原材料类型时，在这种情况下，原材料类型的值是原材料的类型，这些元素可以被衡量用于区分一个原材料是否确实需要成为原材料类型。
Of particular interest are the VALUES of each ATTRIBUTE for ASSET TYPES when the ASSET TYPES are MATERIAL TYPES. In this case, the VALUES for a MATERIAL TYPE constitute its MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS, and the ATTRiBUTES given these values are the variables that will be measured to determine if a particular sample of material is indeed of that MATERIAL TYPE. This is discussed in detail in Chapters Eight (The Laboratory) and Ten (Process Manufacturing).

figure 4.16 is an example of meta-model - a model of models.that is,modeling element are themselves things of significance to us.A meta-model provides such interesting things as an entity called attribute,which of course has attributes of its own.we will encounter more meta-models throughout the book.

**Note that the meta-model approach is vert powerful as a way to describing complex data.In some case,it is only way to represent data accurately and cleanly.**Note also,however,that data stored in this form are very difficult to retrieve.

Instead of asking for the ASSET TYPES whose" capacity" is at least 30G gallons/minute, you must ask for the ASSET TYPES that are described by VALUES of the ATTRlBUTE "capacity," whose "value" (of VALUE, that is) is greater than 300 gallons/minute. Some would consider this to be unduly complicated. Typically, systems derived from such a model use it as the basis for design of the data-base that will gather and maintain the data, but add to the system a provision for extracting the data and storing it for retrieval in tables structured in a more familiar way.

举个例子，数据可以被提取到一系列表其中每个表都是为每个资产类型类别定义的，每个表都是一种资产类型。之前，我们不想这么做，是因为这需要我们增删表，当资产类型改变时。但用这种原数据模型，我们可以字段生产表模型。
For example, data could be extracted into a set of tables in which a separate table is defined for each ASSET TYPE CLASS, and an occurrence of each table is an ASSET TYPE. Previously, we didn't want to do that because of the resultant need to add and delete tables as the list of ASSET TYPES changes.With this model,however, we can automate the process of generating the tables themselves from the meta-model.

## A VARIATION（变化）

我们目前所见但例子都是制造业公司。尽管他们有区别。
The examples we've seen so far in this chapter are from manufacturing companies. Even though there are variations between, say, a manufacturer of pencils and one that produces heavy equipment, we have seen fundamental similarities in the descriptions of the things all manufacturers make and use.

显示出相似性在世界的制造业。一个银行，处理统计，这就是银行的产品。银行不会消费原生的原材料去生产他们。银行的模型看起来非同寻常得相似与制造业相比。特别的，银行也有我们之前描述的问题，比如产品类型（帐户类型）有不同的元素。
It turns out that these similarities extend beyond the world of manufacturing. A bank, for example, deals with ACCOUNTS. These are the products of a bank, and while the bank does not consume raw materials to produce them, the structure of the bank model looks remarkably similar in other ways to our manufacturing model. In particular, the bank has the problem we described above, where different product types (ACCOUNT TYPE) have different attributes(PARAMETERS). The resulting model, then, as shown in Figure 4.17 with parameters, parameter assignments, and values, looks remarkably like the manufacturing model of Figure 4.16.

所以无论，组织操作说明，这些实体描述了他们的抽象。
So, whatever the things an organization manipulates, the entity or entities describing them can be placed along the bottom of the drawing. This may be a single pair of entities describing ASSET and ASSET TYPE (or PRODUCT and PRODUCT TYPE, or even ACCOUNT and ACCOUNT TYPE), or it may be a more complex construction to accommodate variations in the structure of these things. Whatever the particulars, virtually every organization will have need to model the objects of its efforts.

## 总结

讨论的是企业生产和消耗的sth,先说产品和产品类型。
然后觉得product不够抽象，提出了asset和asset type，因为这些东西都是公司的资产，公司的资产类型里有产品类型。

接下来谈inventory，因为之前谈的都是物理性质的商品，但是有些商品的计量单位比较古怪，比如厕纸啊。然后就提出了inventory来聚集这类的产品。把asset type都给抽象描述出来。

接下来谈产品的构造，一个产品可能由多个产品构成，这其中有几种变形的模型图，当模型图过于复杂，就把这种构造作为一个基础模型。

然后谈产品里的元素，这个时候就提到里meta-data-model，模型中的模型，把值和名称剥离。

最后举例，上述的模型不仅适用于生产类企业，也适用于银行这类虚拟的，只要是这个企业主要操纵的东西，都可以用抽象模型来描述
