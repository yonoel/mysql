# The enterprise and its world

An enterprise cannot exist without people.

A few of things to be known about a person,such as "name" or "birth date",are the attribute of person entity.Others(more than you suppose)are not actually attributes,but are relationships to other entities,as we shall see.A person may enroll in one or more courses,for example,or may play a role in one or more activities.

again,save yourself sometime,put organization on you model even before you start to interview.

## Parties

人和组织都算作是个party，这是超类。

People and organizations share many attributes and many relationships to other entities.A corporation is,after all,a "legal person".both people and organizations have "names" and "address" as attribute,and both may be parties to contracts.for this reason,while person and organization are things of significance,so too is the super-set of the two,which we shall here call party,In figure 3.1.

to get attributes,however,we will have to interview someone.enterprise differ greatly in the kinds of information they want to hold about people and organization.

while virtually all companies and government agencies have need for the person and organization entities,how these entities are divided into subtypes will vary from company to company.

从人出发，先定义雇员和其他人。
beginning with the person entity,a common practice is to assert that a person may be either an employee or an other person.(see figure3.2)an employee is usually thought of as a thing of significance to an employer.

from a practical point of view,this can work,especially since employees often have an extensive set of attributes that don't apply to other perseon

发现问题，一个人可能同时归类到2种类型，过去，现在。
there are problems with defining employee as an entity,however:First,a person may fall into more than one of these categories.consultants and other contractual workers are also problematic,since a lot of employee-type information may be held,even though such people are not,strictly speaking,employees.if these are significant issues in your organization,the employee/other person distinction is not appropriate.

其次，雇员这个词包含了雇佣关系，那目前这个模型只支持1对1，不支持1对多。
what you have in the word "employee" is a common name for sth including in its meaning not just the thing itself,but also its relationship to sth else.Figure3.3 show this relationships:Each person may be currently employed by one and only one organization,and the organization may be the employer of one or more people.

由于可能存在多对多关系，因此我们把这种关系建模。
show it this way,however,raise the question of what to do with the employment-specific attribute.it is also probably that over time,a person may be employed by more than one organization.For these reason,an additional entity probably will be describe the relationship fully.Figure 3.4 shows the additional of the entity employment,to solve the problem.Note each employment must be of a person with an organization.each person may be in one or more employments,and each organization may be the source of one or more employments.

employments attributes such as "number of exemptions" go in this entity.employment may also have the attribute "type",to distinguish between full-time employees,part-time employees,and contractors.

Note that there is some ambiguity in this model.the model dose not and can not make explicit an assumption probably made by viewers----that a person will be in only one employment at a time.

## employee assignments

更加复杂的雇佣关系声明，比如一个人在一个组织同时有多种title。
A person's complete relationship to an organization,however,can be more complex,Figure 3.5 show this.

First,the position held by a person is itself sth of significance,with attributes such as "pay grade" and "job description".Typically defined by one organization,the position is likely to be held by more the one person.

all this argues for specification of position assignment(the fact that a person holds the position,for a period of time,beginning with "start date" and lasting until the "end date").That is each position assignment must be of a person to a position.each person,then,may be in one or more position assignments.

there are many variations on this model.

## organization

一个常规的方式是把组织切分为内部组织和拓展组织
A common approach to ORGANIZATION is to divide it into INTERNAL ORGANIZATION and EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION.

An INTERNAL ORGANIZATION could be, for example,

+ a DEPARTMENT,
+ a DIVISION, or
+ some OTHER INTERNAL ORGANIZATION.

Figure 3.8 shows this, as well as the world of the EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION, which could be

+ a CORPORATION,
+ a GOVERNMENT AGENCY, or
+ some OTHER EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION.

Note once again that, when we split out kinds of organizations, attributes of EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION, such as "purpose/' apply to all external organizations, but attributes of each subtype (such as "Federal tax ID" in CORPORATION) apply only to that subtype.

## address

party可能会有多个地址
parties are usually located somewhere.in its simplest form,the model could include "address" as an attribute of party.the problem with this is that organizations at least,and many people too,have more than one address.

this argues for adding a second entity address(Figure3.9).

so,we have now made address a thing of significance.this's not unreasonable,if you think an office,a home or a work center.Making address a thing of significance,however,leads to a problem:we have asserted that each address must be the location of one and only one party......we have not expressed the concept of address as an identified place.

to clarify this,we will rename address entity as site.a site is place with designated purpose.

一个地址可能被多个party引用，因此又有了关系模型（placement）
because more than one person or organization may be located at a site,we now need an entity to represent each fact that a party is located at a site.we could call this address,and in many companies' model,it is.because of the ambiguity described above in the way we used "address",however,perhaps it would be better to invent a new word.in Figure 3.10,it is shown as placement.each placement must be of a party at a site.

attribute of placement include the date it happens("effective date")and the date it is discontinued("until date").placement also can be categorized via the attribute type.

## geographic locations

由地图上的地址引发出层级关系。。一个地图地址可能有多个site，怎么统计？
such a solution may be adequate for many applications,but often it is of interest to collect address by city,country,postal code,ot other geographic location where the address is located.each site,then,must be in one geographic location-which mean that each geographic location may be the location of one or more site(Figure 3.11).

the attribute of geographic location would of course include its "name," ans possibly a "geographic location type," such as "state," "country," "province," and so forth.

with all this,what about our original problem of modeling a mailing address?unfortunately,the answer is,"It depends".

site里放最细节的元素
The purest answer, then, in terms of the logic of the model, would be to put most of the address in successive GEOGRAPHICLOCATIONS as shown, with only the most detailed element defined in SITE.

注意，这种特殊情况并不意味着关注计算机处理的性能，而是体现了数据意味着不同的东西对于不同的人而言。
note that this deference to practicality is not an example of concern for more efficient computer processing.it is recognition of the fact that the data mean  different thing to different people. If, to a user community, "address" is a single attribute, the model should reflect that as long as that community is made aware of the possibility that this view could change in the future, and the implications of that change. If, on the other hand, the user community is interested in using "address" in many different ways, the more complex model would be more appropriate.

地址的数据模型提供了一个例子并没有一个正确的模型例子。最终产品不仅反应了潜在的数据构造，同时也表达了组织所需要的数据图。我们一定要问自己这个问题，这个模型对于企业的意义（独特性）在哪里？
the address data model provide an example of a case in which there is no right model.the final product must reflect not only the underlying structure of data,but also the view of that data held by the organization.specifically,we must ask the question,"what are the things of significance to the company or agency?"

Having asked that, however, we must note that both views may be held in the Same organization: One department only wants mailing labels, while another wants to do detailed geographic market research. In such a case, the modeler must go with the more conceptual approach and, when the system is implemented, provide for the more mundane user needs through application "views."" The more complex model is truer to the conceptual structure of the data, and can accommodate all the other perspectives. None of this, by the way, addresses what the final physical database structure will look like. The designer must be the final arbiter of what will actually work in the organization's computers.

然后吧啦吧啦讲了一个复杂的地图地址模型，不写了

介绍构造模型。
Life is more complicated, for example, in those cases in which geography is not strictly hierarchical. Cities are usually inside counties, except for New York , for example, which has five counties inside it. Also, in the United States, a ZIP code is normally entirely within a city, but not always: In Oregon, ZIP
code 97401 encompasses both Coburg and part of Eugene. Eugene also has several other ZIP codes within it.

例子，处理原生加拿大的部落，这个部落不在这个省内，这个省内也不在部落领土里。
In another example, a project dealing with Native Canadians required a model to deal with the case in which a tribal land covered portions of more than one province. The land could not be considered inside the province, and the province was certainly not inside the tribal land.

These examples make it necessary to define an additional entity, GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENT,each occurrence of which would describe the fact that part of one GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION is part of another. This is shown in Figure 3.13. Each GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION may be composed of one or more GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENTS each of which must be the presence of one other GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.Alternatively, each GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION may be a part in one or more GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENTS each of which must be in another GEO-GRAPHIC LOCATION.

In the Native-Canadian land case, for example, each occurrence of a tribal land parcel's existence in a province constitutes one GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENT. That is, if a tribal land were in Quebec and Ontario, the land's GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION be composed of two GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE ELEMENT.one representing the presence of part of the land in Quebec, and one representing the presence of part of it in Ont"rio.

## reporting relationships

雇员关系是一种例子，实际上会有很多种类型，我们需要一个更加范性的方式去描述这种关系
employment and position assignments are examples of relationships that may exist between people and organization.there are in fact many others.Consequently,we need a more general approach to relating people and organization to each other.

一个组织由一个或多个组织构成
figure2.6 show that each organization may be composed of one or more organizations.

在第一章，我们假定所有组织都是相同的，来结束了多层组织的讨论。可是我们如何画出一个组织由不同的子组织构成的层级模型图呢
in chapter one,we ended the discussion of organization when we established that all organizations are fundamentally the same.it's important,however,that we also know how to draw a hierarchy when the top (or bottom)element(in this case,organization)is significantly different from others.

for example,we might wish to assert that a corporation is fundamentally different from an other organization.this distinction may be expressed in either two way:

第一种，每个组织必定是另一个并且一定是另一个组织的部分，或者必定是这个企业的一部分。注意，我们就可以说一个组织必定是另一个组织的部分，从层级的顶部开始就开始弧线箭头就有效了。对于最后一步，每一个组织必定是企业的一部分。我们依然可以说这是一个层级，因为底部只有这一个元素。
the first is shown in figure 3.15.in this,each other organization must be part of one and only one other organization or it must be part of corporation.Note that we can say each organization must be part of another organization,since at the top of hierarchy the other side of the acr take effect.For that last step,each organization must be part of a corporation.we still must say "may be" going down the hierarchy,since there is no defined bottom to it.

第二种，从继承的头部元素的区分点就要开始描述出来，类似其他每个元素（可能会更简介或更负责，看你选择）。在这个图里，每一个组织必定也是另一组织的部分。通过这种方法，每个组织可能由一个，也可能由多个组织构成。
the second way a distinction may be drawn between the top element in a hierarchy and all the others is shown in figure 3.16.in this diagram,each other organization must be part of an organization.going the way,each organization may be composed of only one or more other organizations.

所有这些都会很正常，直到你开始处理政府机构。它表明一个组织不一仅是一个组织的部分。这是一个多对多关系。这就需求我们去添加一个实体去描述每一个这种情况的发生。
all of this is well and good,until you start dealing with a government agency.it turns out not to be the case that an organization may be part of only one organization.the pig's ear turns out to represent a many-to-many relationships.this requires us to add an entity describing each occurrence of an organization being part of another.

这种添加的实体是另一个构造实体的例子，想之前讨论的地图构造元素。在这次案例里，我们添加了报告关系。每个报告关系必定是一个组织在另一个组织的发生状况。这说明，每个组织必定由一个或者多个报告关系来构成。
the entity added is another example of a "structure" entity ,like the geographic structure element discussed above.in this case,we have added reporting relationships in figure 3.17.each reporting relationship must be the occurrence of one organization in another organization..that is,each organization may be composed of one or more reporting relationships,each of which is of another organization.

我们就会面对另一个问题。这是有可能并且经常必须的去描述人和组织之间的关系。
having established reporting relationships between organizations,but we face another issue.it is possible and often necessary to describe relationships between people as well,and the relationships between people and organizations.

我们之前看到了雇佣关系在人和组织之间，因为这种关系经常直接引用，若需要特殊的对待，就会被特殊模型化。这仅是一种例子，在两个party可能由多种关系，比如婚姻关系，人归属于联盟和俱乐部，局包含部门，同样的企业绑定一起到行业协会。
we've already seen employment s one relationship between people and organizations.because it's often referred to directly,and requires special treatment,it was modeled explicitly.this is only one example,however,of a relationships that can exist between two parties.People are married to each other;people belong union and clubs;departments are contained in divisions;and companies band together into industrial associations.

出于这样到目的，我们模糊了报告关系去覆盖所有到关系在两个人或者组织之间。我们依然会生成这些关系名称，去表达每个报告关系必定是从一个party指向另一个。相对的，一个party必定是一个或者多个关系的一部分。
For this reason,we have generalized reporting relationships in figure 3.18 to cover any relationship between two people or organizations.we also generalized the relationship names,to say that each reporting relation must be from one party to another.Conversely , a party may be on one side of one or more relationships,and a party may also be on the other side of one or more relationships.

This does not negate the value of also showing EMPLOYMENT, as we did before, but it does allow us to represent any other relationship between two parties. The most important attributes of this entity are the "effective date" of a relationship, its "until date," and its reporting relationship "type," such as "organizational structure," "club membership," "family relationship," and the like. REPORTING RELATIONSHIP, then, is the fact that one PARTY is related to another at a particular time.

The power of this concept may be seen in many areas. For example, hospitals commonly band together into buying groups to obtain quantity discounts on purchases of pharmaceuticals and other hospital supplies. A buying group's blanket purchase order specifies a group discount, and allows each member hospital to issue a purchase order for items at that group price. To handle this arrangement, it is a simple matter to define the buying group as an ORGANIZATION, and identify a blanket purchase order for it, specifying the prices. When a participating hospital's purchase order is received, it is necessary only to look up any buying group with which the hospital has established a REPORTING RELATIONSHIP.once the contract price negotiated for that groups been found, it may then be applied to the purchase by the individual hospital.

REPORTING RELATIONSHIP allows any relationships among people and organizations to be defined. As mentioned above, the special case of people's relationships with their employers is elaborated in the entities POSITION ASSIGNMENT, TITLE,and POSITION. These entities will appear in many data models.

## About types

注意，我们特别声明报告关系的类型作为一个元素，之前由，地址，地图定位，职位一样也有类型属性。party没有类型属性，但是可以有。
Note,that we have specified reporting relationships "type" as an attribute.previously,employment,site,geographic location,and position assignment also have attribute "type".party didn't show a "type" attribute,but it could have.

in each case,presumably there is a finite list of possible values for the attribute.the "...types" attribute may be handled in one of three ways:

如果类型是一个相对温度的列表，它就能被领域模型包含。可选方案是，若这个列表相对比较短，可以作为子类存在。
if this list is relatively stable,it may be contained in a domain for the types.That is,the list of values for the attribute is documented in the data dictionary as a relatively fixed list.Alternatively,if the list is also comparatively short,each of the "...types" could be shown as a subtype of reporting relationship.

如果类型是动态并且可变的，那就需要作为一个实体来模型化。
if the list is dynamic and variable,however,or if there is a reason to display the fact such a list exist,it can be shown in the model as a new entity.the entity can be named reporting relationship type,where each reporting relationship must be an example of one and only one reporting relationship type,and each reporting relationship type may be embodied in one or more reporting relationships.

in short,it is possible to deal with reporting relationship type(or any type) either as an attribute with a defined domain,as a set of subtypes,or as a relationship to a type ...entity.

## About points of view

you will find in this book a bias toward creating the purest models possible,with an emphasis on describing things in terms abstract enough to encompass a wide range of circumstances.in the course of this chapter,however,we have discovered the purest model to be often in conflict with practical issues of addressing the perspectives of future system users.

in real projects,however,you rarely are called upon to encompass a wide range of circumstances.your client or user will have a practical problem to be addressed quickly and in terms that he or she understands.it may be unavoidable that you have to draw a model in those terms.So be it.The rent must be paid.Even when this happens,however,it is to your advantage at least understand the more abstract model.You may even want to sketch it out on paper and file it,so you have answer if(when?)the clients has a change of mind and widening of perspective-immediately followed by the demand for you to deal with it("I know that's what I said then,but this is now!!!")

## 总结

从企业开始说起，企业有人，有组织，人和组织可以共用一个模型party，区分就是组织带有purpose，人有出生日期。

接着既然是企业，那肯定有雇员，这种人和普通人不一样，但是属于人的分支，其次某一雇员肯定属于某一个组织。后来发现实际上是某个雇员会属于多个组织，也就是多对多，因此把这种关系描述出来成一个entity，也就是employment，employment，由人和组织共同构成。

接下来谈雇员肯定有不同的雇员啊，岗位职责不一样，这些岗位是由组织来决定的，一个雇员也会同时拥有多个position，一个position可能会由多个人所hold，发现job和人之间也是多对多，这个关系也只能再次描述成一个entity，也就是position assignment，其中的position由组织定义。

这其中就有很多可能性，如果定position是企业级别的，但是department用title来区分他们，这样的化，position assignment里填充的就是title，不是position。

也可以简单的给position assignment加个type来区分。

如果在复杂一点，也就是用之前的employment来描述雇员和组织的关系，那么employment里就会放置position assignment，position依旧有组织来定义。

人谈完了，就是开始谈组织。首先组织可能分不同的部门，吧啦吧啦，有内部的，有外部的。

然后开始谈一些元素，首先是地址，party里的元素都有地址，但是它很复杂，抽成一个模型来描述，然后发现address有点企业，一个人，一个企业可能有多个address，有些精确，有些模糊，同一个address可能指向一个地方，然后就再次抽象成一个placement，每个placement对应一个site。

在谈物理地址，之前的那种设计已经能处理大多数情况，但是还有更复杂的，即一个placement可能对应多个实际地址，然后site下面在抽象一层location。。。接下来就没看了，无非就是抽象location。。

在谈组织之间的关系，之前说，组织由组织组成，但是万一需要一个特殊组织怎么描述，这里就描述了一个corporation的两种描述方法；这是单例，万一这类的太多怎么办，很简单，再次描述一个关系实体reporting relationship。

然后谈谈出现多个类型怎么办，


if this list is relatively stable,it may be contained in a domain for the types.That is,the list of values for the attribute is documented in the data dictionary as a relatively fixed list.Alternatively,if the list is also comparatively short,each of the "...types" could be shown as a subtype of reporting relationship.

if the list is dynamic and variable,however,or if there is a reason to display the fact such a list exist,it can be shown in the model as a new entity.the entity can be named reporting relationship type,where each reporting relation ship must be an example of one and only one reporting relationship type,and each reporting relationship type may be embodied in one or more reporting relationships.

in short,it is possible to deal with reporting relationship type(or any type)
either as an attribute with a defined domain,as a set of subtypes,or as a relationship to a type ...entity.

1.如果这个类型列表是相对稳定的，那么不如就给domain对象持有着，把这种元素文档化得了，也可以把每个类型都作为个子类存在。

2.如果这个类型列表是动态可变的，而且需要去展示它，那就建模吧！

3.总而言之，作为对象的一个元素，作为一系列的子集，或者作为一个实体。

在谈谈为啥看问题这么抽象？

in real projects,however,you rarely are called upon to encompass a wide range of circumstances.your client or user will have a practical problem to be addressed quickly and in terms that he or she understands.it may be unavoidable that you have to draw a model in those terms.So be it.The rent must be paid.Even when this happens,however,it is to your advantage at least understand the more abstract model.You may even want to sketch it out on paper and file it,so you have answer if(when?)the clients has a change of mind and widening of perspective-immediately followed by the demand for you to deal with it("I know that's what I said then,but this is now!!!")

在实际项目里，需要你封装一个大范围的实际情况。你的客户和用户有特定的问他需要定位和处理。这在你建模时是不可避免的。因此就这么做吧，得付钱啊。可是，你的优势就是通过理解更多的抽象模型，你甚至想把这些记录下来，画下来。你就会去想何时，什么时候，客户改变想法，去处理这些未来可能出现的问题。
