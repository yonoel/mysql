## Data modeling's promise and failure

data modeling server two purposes in the systems analysis process:

1. First,as a graphic tech,it aids in communication between analysts and the ultimate user of the system they will specify,and between analysts those who will design and build system for the users.
2. Second,as a rigorous tech,it imposes discipline on the specification of problems,ensuring due consideration of logical implications.

Dta modeling as current practiced suffers from two problems:

1. Diagrams are often difficult to read.
2. Diagrams do not represent the fundamental nature of the organizations the are supposed to describe.

### Clarity

讲为啥要清晰得表达模型，说图形的不足。

### Fundamentals of the business

if you choose to build a new system,you want it to reflect the true requirements of your business-not simply to reproduce the tech and technology now in use.the reason for marking the investment in the first place is that **you want to change the way things are done,without necessarily changing the nature of your enterprise.**

a data model can help change the wat things are done without affecting the nature of your business if it presents what is unchanging in an organization.it's intended to portray the things of significance about which company wishes to hold info.

if the model succeeds,the things represented are unlikely to change significantly,either the app of new tech or with the making of routine changes to the business of the organization.tech whose arch is based on what is fundamental will improve the operational aspects of the organization while remaining robust,stable,flexible.

unfortunately,what people see in the course of their work is not this unchanging nature at all,but merely examples of it.**they see only today's problems,and the particular tech they must use to do their jobs-to the point that the tech becomes their jos.**since the info an analyst gathers,therefore,is usually expressed in terms of current practices,distinguishing between what is essential to business and what is merely an accident of current tech is not always easy.the essential facts are the things that "go without saying"-so they don't said.these facts don't get described or explained-or reflected in new system.instead,new systems are often built on superficial views of today's problems.

### how standards can help

both communication and discipline can be improved.moreover,we can make better use of each other's work.what is needed is standardization of our approach to the modeling process.this does not mean simply using a common system of notation,although that would certain help.what is means,rater,is using a common approach to the way we think about business situations,and to the way we organize our presentations of them.this book is about these "conventions of thought".

## about modeling conventions

in fact,three levels of convention apply to data modeling:

1. syntactic conventions are the most basic level of defining models.these conventions dictate the symbols to be used.the symbols portray the things of significance to the enterprise(entities),and the relationships among them.relationships symbols include those for cardinality(the "one" and "many" in a "one-to-many" relationship) and optionality(whether or not an occurrence of one entity must be related to an occurrence of the other entity).many notation schemes also include symbols for describing how occurrences of entities are identified,even to the point of specifying the primary key that would be used in a relational database implementations of the models.syntactic conventions may also include rules for the structure of phrases used to name relationships and entities.syntactic conventions are the subject of most data modeling books.
2. positional conventions define the way symbols are organized on a page.that is ,they concern the relative positions of elements,and they address the overall organization of a drawing.
3. semantic conventions have to do with grouping of entities according to their meaning.these are the primary subject of this book.these conventions pertain to the way we think about business situations.

taking this pattern-based approach to data modeling has several advantages:

1. it makes the task of building a new model easier and faster(and therefore cheaper,which after all,is what makes up popular with our bosses),since the modeler has only to modify and blend existing structures,rather than create new ones from scratch.
2. it makes the models easier to read,since the same kinds of things will tend to take the same shape in all diagrams.
3. this in turn make it possible to highlight things that are genuinely unique about a particular enterprise.
4. it helps reduce or eliminate gross modeling errors,since the basic elements of a model are defined.
5. it will result in a system with fewer tables to maintain,simplifying it and marking it more reliable,since relatively few entities can desc many specific aspects of a situation.

## These models and your organization

## models and systems:a word about implementation

the models presented in this book,however,are more abstract than typically used to develop real system.this causes some developers to be uneasy about developing databases from them.because of the peculiar nature of the models created using the approach described in this book,two assertions about the implications of these models on the systems that result from them are in order:

1. First,if these models are implemented as shown,the resulting systems will be much more robust and flexible than if they are not.the tables will be organized according to aspects of the enterprise that are unlikely to change soon.as mentioned above,the content of the tables will define much of what traditionally has been part of program code and table structure.the user will now specify the config of the business,rather than the programmer.this is not what we are used to,but it is not a bad thing.
2. Second,these models are expected to be produced during the strategic planning and requirements analysis phase of system development.they are not intended to represent the physical structure of database that are finally implemented.in response to problems of processing time,system capacity,or other constraints,the designer may have to construct database structures that differ from these,in order to reflect the circumstances of the particular system being built.
